## Development and Contributing

HubSync uses [Bundler](http://gembundler.com) to manage its dependencies during
development. To begin development, fork [dirtyalpaca/hubsync][1], ensure you
have Bundler >= 1.0.0 installed and run `bundle install` inside the clone of
your fork.

Specs can be run via `rake spec` and features via `rake cucumber`.

Code coverage for both specs and features is automatically generated on each run
via SimpleCov.

The workflow for contributing code to HubSync is as follows:

* Fork [dirtyalpaca/hubsync][1].
* Create a topic branch for your feature or bug fix.
* Include specs (and features if appropriate) for your code (it won't be
  accepted otherwise).
* Create an issue in HubSync's [issue tracker][2] if there isn't one already.
* Link to the topic branch you created in the issue's description or your
  comments.
* Send me a [pull request](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)
